The difference between a dashboard and a report. 

♪ Report: ♪
1. We always work on data flow from data sources. 

2. A comprehensive analysis is used for the purpose of a detailed and in-depth analysis of the data. 

3. High Interactive 

4. Work in: Microsoft Power Bi Desktop 

♪ Dashboard ♪ 
1. Present a summary of the details.

2. It's a multi-report. 

3. The aim is to observe and take a quick look at visions. 

4. Less interactive 

5. Work in: Microsoft online power bi platform 


If you need detailed analysis, a report may be the appropriate option. If you wish to summarize the data and provide a quick look, Dashboard is the best option. 


📍As we continue the analysis of the data from the Work Adventure of Bikes, I create a report to achieve the goal of the company, which is to recognize the performance of sales and orders for the past month to identify growth opportunities and keep it competitive.
